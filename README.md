# Hand_written_Digits_Recognition

## Dataset Description
The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It stands for "Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology" and is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). It has a Training set of 60,000 images and a Testing set of 10,000 images.

We have performed Convolution Neural Network (CNN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the handwritten digits.

Challenges faced:
No such challenges we have to face because it is an MNIST dataset, So No EDA we need to perform.
